# WeatherAPI

First created a basic html file with what has to be presented, which I then followed it up with a style.css to adjust where the content has to be displayed and also gave them styles.Finally I created a app.js where most of the code is done.I created a event listenser which I used navigator.geolocation to search the browser to find the current location. After it was followed up by fetching the api from darksky.net. I created a long and lat which i got from the DarkSky Api. I used those as query strings in the api with a proxy. After fetching the api I retrieved the temperature,icon, daily weather summary, description of the upcoming days.I had to fetch the icon because I used the icons from skycons.js.I also created two helper functions which adjusts the Name to remove a _ and /. The other function was to adjust the Icons names from the api.
